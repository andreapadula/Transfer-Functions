# Transfer-Functions

In this application I implemented my own transfer function. I decided to take inspiration from the paraview transfer function. I really like that transfer function not its incredible functionality, but for the fact that it is very easy to use. In fact, the user can basically interact with the values of opacity and color using the widget. The user my moving the point in the graph up and down can modify or add opacity points. To add the user will simply click on a space that is not used by other points. To modify the user will just click on point (selecting) and move around the graph. The color function display the colors currently use in the transfer function. And it can be modified by simply clicking on the bar to add a point. Upon clicking the color bar the user then can select the color of his/her choice, by simply modifying the rgb values that will appear on the left of the screen and that the user can interact. Moreover, the user will see the preview of the color select in a small box. The user also has the possibility to select and move the points in the color map. Also by pressing the letter “d” the program will enter in delete mode and it can delete the points previously added. When a circle is selected on the top of the screen will appear  a rectangle with the values of the current position.
The user also have the possibility to set shading and the use set the isovalue. This will change the color map, but it won’t be possible to add or modify colors or opacity. The isovalue slider will only allow the user to see selected range of iso value with different colors. This part was implemented by the professor and I decided to leave inside to have extra functionality. I didn’t implement these features.

The result looks like this: 

![Alt text](A06P01/image5.png?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](A06P01/image3.png?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](A06P01/image4.png?raw=true "Title")
